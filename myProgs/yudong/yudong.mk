# UPDATED PROTOCOL FOR myProgs/USERNAME usage
#
# Example:
# for objects Obj1.h/Obj1.cpp and Obj2.h/Obj2.cpp
#
# MYSOURCE   = Obj1 Obj2
#
# for programs prog1.cpp prog2.cpp
#
# MYPROGS    = prog1 prog2
#
# To compile (from the MSL/trunk directory):
# Objects:
#   make objs/Obj1.o
#   make objs/Obj2.o
#
# Programs:
#   make bin/prog1
#   make bin/prog2
